* Problem — My functions were using unapproved PowerShell verbs (like 'Protect' or 'Redact'), which caused style warnings and went against best practices.
* Fix     — All my PowerShell functions must follow the standard Verb-Noun naming convention, and the verb MUST be one of the officially approved verbs. You can see the full list by running Get-Verb in PowerShell. For custom or complex actions, Invoke is a safe and compliant choice. The noun should be specific, like DeloraSecretRedaction.
* Example — The evolution of our function was: Protect-DeloraSecrets (non-compliant) → Invoke-DeloraSecretRedaction (compliant and correct).
